                <h2>Hello, and welcome to The Book Nook! </h2>
                <p class="notop">
                    We are a local family business that opened their doors in 2020.
                    We strongly believe that books are knowledge, and that it should be accessible for everyone. In 2022
                    we noticed a lot of librarys had closed, and started the Reading Room addition to our store. We
                    accept gently used books, in exchange for a coupon for our store to get a new read! The books in the
                    Reading Room are free of charge, and yours to keep or trade in.
                    <br>
                    The Book Nook is located in Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Newfoundland. We are passionate about serving
                    our local community, our Reading Room is only available locally however our store is open in person
                    and online. Go to our <a href="./html/contact.html">Contact Us Page </a>for hours and contact
                    information.
